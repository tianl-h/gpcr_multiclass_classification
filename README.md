# Multi-Class Classification of GPCR Allosteric Modulators

This repository contains the machine learning code for the paper "Integrated Multi-Class Classification and Prediction of GPCR Allosteric Modulators by Machine Learning Intelligence".

## Description

The paper presents machine learning models to classify compounds as allosteric modulators for 10 different GPCR subtypes across families A, B, and C. Six machine learning algorithms (SVM, MLP, RF, NB, DT, LR) were trained on datasets with different molecular feature representations including Atom-pair fingerprints, ECFP6 fingerprints, MACCS fingerprints, and molecular descriptors. The best model achieved strong performance in discriminating the allosteric modulators from inactive compounds across the 11 classes with 0.974 AUC, 0.976 Accuracy, and 0.950 Balanced Accuracy.
